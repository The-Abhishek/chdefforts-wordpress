# WordPress Child Theme Template Readme

Use the child theme to do the edits.

## How to Use

1. Create a folder in /wp-content/themes/{your_theme_name}/
2. Copy both `functions.php` and `style.css` from this gist into that folder.
3. Replace all text in {braces} with appropriate values for your theme
      - There are replacements in both files! The theme likely won't work if you don't make all replacements and remove all braces
  
## What Comes Next
